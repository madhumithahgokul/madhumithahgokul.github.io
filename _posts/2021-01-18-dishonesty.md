“… the truth is where we are going to end up inevitably, then why don’t we just start with it? And save the drama?”- Elizabeth Gilbert.

Also her “... we lie and dissemble and manipulate because we’re people- pleasers... And, what you really call a people-pleaser is a people-manipulator. And that’s what a people-manipulator does is manipulate people for their own safety...They’re keeping themselves perceived as safe”

She is not talking to me or at least about me. Is she? 

'Manipulate' is a big word. It’s a word that I don’t like for myself and in others. But then why do I feel that I have been a manipulator in silence for as long as I can remember? I’d like to find out.

I like to think of myself as an honest person. I speak from my heart, I have not heard feedback that I am pretentious of any sort or that I feign confidence when I shouldn’t. Good start.

However, simple questions like “How are you doing?”, “Have you told them what this means to you?”, “Have you finished that priority task yet?” or “Can you help me?” sometimes trigger an instant urge to lie when I’m not feeling up to being honest. What difference does it make if I say I am on it when I haven’t even started and I know I will deliver regardless, or if I say I’m alright when I’m not or don’t share with anyone what I am going through or processing, or if I say a simple yes to something that doesn’t break me if I do it and get done? Thinking so I bypass the truth and just say  a _little_ lie that _sometimes_ has consequences. 

And if experience was to share her wisdom with me right away, she’d tell me -
* that doing so _always_ has consequences and
* there’s no such thing as a _little_ lie. 

And it’s not always a response to a question that triggers dishonesty in me. Not saying something when I should, which personally for me, is a chunk of where my dishonesty lies. And, most often than not, saying something when it needs to be said, or as soon as it crosses my mind, or right when my body reacts to a particular conversation’s unpleasantness, or a or behavioral disagreement would just be the right thing to do not just for me but for them too.

And each time I don’t express the true words, I feel that I, using my own hands, just chiseled away a small piece of my integrity _forever_.

And for all I know, maybe no one was there to tell that someone how their conversations and expressions appear manipulative to the person hearing them. And I breaking the news in a gentle way could be a breakthrough moment in their lives, or if they were doing it intentionally, then at least, they stop conversing under the assumption that my intelligence has gone for a walk in broad daylight.

Or maybe that opinionated human hasn't heard _enough_ from others that their way of thinking has expired along with the death of dinosaurs, for the loss of sugar-coats in my words. And when I express my disagreement chaperoned in respect and empathy, I may influence their thinking a teeny-tiny bit. 

Or, maybe I am angry or sad or discontent or not so joyful and it _is_ imperative for that person to know. They may need to know how disapproving I am of their statement, behavior or action, or that I expect different if not better or that they are better than what they portrayed of themselves in that situation.

And even if I am well aware of how my dad could lose sleep obsessing over my health, I owe him the response, “No dad, my health remains sucky because of my sheer inability to control my diet, or eat in a disciplined way or make fitness my priority till date.” And at that very moment, my self-inflicted shame through those words of sincerity and truth could be a game-changer. Maybe.

And, things don’t always have to be life and death, or even negative (something for me to definitely write about in the days to come, Truth in Happiness), for that matter. Saying that I am not hungry when I am just being lazy to go fix myself a meal, or saying Yes because I didn’t have the courage to say No because I fear what ‘they might think’, or forcing myself to do something to gain someone’s approval or not asking the right questions fearing the ridicule I might put myself through, or not giving when it’s the right thing to do, or not giving first, all these and other million elements that may add to this list, chisel me away. Bit by bit. And can these not contribute to manipulation? 

Before I know it, being dishonest with myself and to the world around me becomes a habit, a second nature. I become a piece of work that I am not so proud of. I convince myself that being quiet or dishonest caused no hurt to anyone and that I should be ok. But my thoughts digress from reality. I am the exact opposite of ok. I end up in bed with the Replaying Disease - only with a myriad replays of how I could have asked that deserving question or said the most fitting comment thing or done it differently. And that disease eats away sleep, aggravates ulcers and messes up my mood. A moody me is not exactly someone that I can befriend to begin with.

Then why do I _still_ advocate for dishonesty through my actions? 

It’s easy. It’s the path of least resistance. I’ve trained my mind and body to get used to the consequences of my lies and dishonesty. 

I fear what _they_ will think of me.

I fear the consequences of courage, and of the other person’s anger, displeasure, surprise/shock, and disapproval of me and my thought process.

I was raised by a humble and docile woman and I am a woman, and speaking out or speaking up will come across as arrogance which the world disapproves of. 

I don’t have the confidence to support my truth claims with calm confidence. I resort to anger at that point rather than intelligence and that has back-fired so many times that it feels safe to shut up than speak up.

I don’t know how to detach myself from the consequences of the truth.

I’m egoistic. I’d rather lie than be told that I am wrong or that my feelings are invalid and that I’m emotional. Over emotional to be precise.

Do these excuses still justify my habit? Nope. Not even to me. Not even remotely.

I’ve lived 3 whole decades of my life in my head, lying and manipulating. I say that’s enough. Doesn’t mean that I can gear the courage up instantly. I’m human and it’s a process, I say to myself. A process that needs lots of figuring out, trying, and failing and trying again to figure out more. It may take years or may be another decade for me to write about my transformations and my experiments with truth, and I’m okay with that. 

And as someone that believes in the slight edge of things, for something to work tomorrow, there’s a desperate need to start today. And, I start calmly.

So, she indeed _was_ talking _to_ me, about _me_! And I _have_ heard her.

2020 has been a handful, and isn't over yet. But amidst all its disturbances and disappointments, 2020 gave me the best gift that there ever is. Of time. Time to go through, get over, and grow. Time to write, all sorts of stories - in my mind and on paper, and today, the one I wrote is for sharing. 
 
Home isn’t where I was born, raised or lived. Or even live for that matter. Home's definitely not where I have had, or have the best of memories. Neither it is who I am born with nor where I am married. 
 
It’s where I can freely let my mediocrity flourish, my vulnerabilities dance to the tunes of my imperfections and be a below average me and yet not be bothered by it. Home is where there isn’t a need for an agenda, a goal to strive for or to shine bright. My home accepts me for my laziness and sometimes even for the keen desire to just be so plain, that my inner goddess is at a state of eternal content. 
 
Home is my writing space, my mom’s lap, my grandpa’s temple. Home is speaking my mind to my pup, it’s easy and simple at the same time. While he listens, he looks into my soul and is ok with what he sees.
 
I feel at home, right now, while I write this open letter to myself.
 
I accept me for not being in competition with the one hundred elements around me, for not wanting to be flawless, for even having frizzy, ungroomed hair ever since I got off the bed this morning, for not knowing, at this very moment, where I am headed, for my absolute inability to be logical when times press for it,  for not wanting the same things as that of my other half, for wanting to be an expert at absolutely nothing at this very moment and for not caring to care, at times.
 
***I*** accept me.
 
I ***accept*** me.
 
I accept ***me***. *Happily*. *Wholeheartedly*. *Truly*. I feel home in me, for me. Right now!

## A little about me

Where it all began: India, yes, I was born and raised there and eventually got inspired to move out *in search of better*.
Why: Why? May be that's idiosyncratic of a rebel, of *me*?! Are all dreamers rebels? I should think so, in varying degress. I dream, *so* beyond my imagination that *my* dreams uproot me off a stable ground every now and then. Sometimes to a different country, so far away from the place the place that once meant to be eternal home. Sometimes to a city that wasn't quite part of the dream. And sometimes, giving me that push to do things that I once never imagined doing, like writing a blog. *This* one. We'll come to that part later.
My roots: I grew up in extremely mediocre finances, in a household of an abundance of never-enoughs. Money and generosity need not always present themselves sequentially, I had come to believe growing up. 
My family, ah! I don't think there could have been a better school to have taught me wholeheartedness. My mom was and still is a queen in that kingdom. 
My core family, extends a little beyond my parents and sis. My life would have been a bottomless pit of literal hell, most certainly to say, without my grandparents, my aunt's family and my first dog, Ruby. I have always seen my family elements as a carefully designed and laid puzzle. 
I was raised as a child of values-values of giving, spirituality, kindness in all shapes and form (one that I am still catching up on), as an individual that was allowed the freedom to dream and to have the courage to make a better reality for myself and for those around me. And for that, I can forever be tied in humility. 

Lets **move *on**.

My beliefs: This may be a good one. I believe in love at first sight - Seattle, a city that I now call home. 
I believe in faith, endurance and acceptance (even if it comes the hardest, freaking way).
I also believe in wholeheartedness, not just because I was trained by the queen, in case you've been paying attention at all, but it just feels right. To be angry, wholeheartedly, to love, wholeheartedly, to give, you know it, to pray, oh definitely to pray with all heart. And, the most important, to let go, wholeheartedly, of useless associations, clutter, a purse with a broken zip or a burnt pan for that matter (you'll read about it in my post, so come back).
Oops, I forgot, to *cry*. With all your mighty heart when you need to and then? Move the crap on!
And, the winner of the My beliefs award goes to Reading. Heck ya! I can scream that one out standing on top of Mission Peak if I have to. I don't have to tell you how reading takes you into a world that's beyond yours, otherwise why in all of humanity's name will you be reading this?  

What am I here to do: Ain't that the questions of the hour, for all of us? 
While I set aside my rhetorical intent for now, let me just say that I have, time and again, heard some people say that I write well. Actually make that many. Feel free to substitute 'well' for coherently, inducing connectiony (sure, I just made that one up) and in a badassary (no, I did not make that one up, my dear reader, Shonda Rhymes did) kinda way. So it made sense to write, in public. 
But the real reason is entwined with a purpose that I intend to create for my life. To empower! Through words, for now. Through honest expressions. And, by providing a window to my world, my life, my mistakes, my anger, my vulnerabilities - basically to my mind and brain. 

I am not a writer by profession, and english is only my second language, so for the lovely critics out there, may I guide you to focus on the content, first. (:

So, read on. And, do show some love.
